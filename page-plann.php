      <h2 class="chunk semi-bold">The Challenge: a small team juggling lots of users </h2>
      <p class="medium">Plann is a data-driven company that needs to be on top of their numbers and analytics to drive growth. Their CMO, Karina May, said that it was previously challenging for them to be data-driven while keeping up the pace of innovation. That‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt have a dedicated business intelligence, email, or CRM team to manage their analytics and messaging full-time. To keep scaling up, the right tooling was crucial and Plann had outgrown their prior stack.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stack-lg">
      <p class="medium">In the past, the tools they were using lacked transparency and flexibility. Not only were they not providing Plann with the view they needed of their campaign successes, but they couldn‚Äôt move as quickly as they needed to drive the business forward.</p>

    </div>

    <div>
      <p class="medium">&ldquo;It just wasn‚Äôt sophisticated enough in terms of data, the workflows, everything.&rdquo; remembered Karina.</p>

      <p class="medium">In collaboration with COO Tim Laurence, Plann chose Vero based on its balance of ease-of-use, functionality and pricing.</p>

      <p class="medium">As a specialist in automation, Karina knew what was available on the market and felt Vero was an ideal fit.</p>

    <blockquote class="case-study-callout bg-white border stack-md center-text">

    <div>
      <p class="medium">As a summary of the above, here‚Äôs how Plann‚Äôs integrations with Vero are set up:</p>

      <div class="stack-md">
        <p class="medium">Plann has four lead sources including WordPress, Unbounce, WebinarJam, and Facebook Ads</p>

        <ul class="plann-legend unstyled-list stack-sm">
          <li class="plann-key plann-key--1">
            <p class="medium">For WebinarJam and Facebook Ads, they use Zapier to pass the lead contacts from their webinars and Facebook Ads campaigns over to Vero.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="plann-key plann-key--2">
            <p class="medium">For WordPress, they use Vero‚Äôs embedded forms to import leads directly from their blog. And for Unbounce, they link up with Vero via webhook integration.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="plann-key plann-key--3">
            <p class="medium">Plann is using Vero‚Äôs Javascript and API to track events, to learn what their users are doing on the backend. They then pass this data over to Vero to trigger workflows.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="plann-key plann-key--3">
            <p class="medium">They also use a mix of server and Google Tag Manager (GTM) for event tracking. While server events are for logged-in user tracking via Javascript, GTM is for non logged-in user tracking.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3 class="tubs regular">üë©‚Äçüíª Empower marketing with data</h3>

      <p class="medium">With Vero‚Äôs flexible APIs, Plann was able to integrate the top-of-funnel and bottom-of-funnel data they needed into one platform.

      <p class="medium">This not only enhanced visibility for the marketing team, making it clear what data was available and safe to use, but gave marketing a ‚Äúplayground‚Äù they could use to iterate, test ideas, and get feedback. All without having to engage engineering for every minor change.</p>

      <p class="medium">&ldquo;Having the ability to have those event triggers means that we can use Vero for more sophisticated in-product emails as well, which I'm excited about because if you have something in the one system, you can then look at the whole behavior of contact versus what they did in this system and that system, explained Karina.</p>

      <p class="medium">Using Vero‚Äôs <strong>Segments</strong> and <strong>Workflows</strong> features enabled Plann‚Äôs marketing team to see and use data any time they need it, without having to wait days or weeks for space in the engineering team‚Äôs sprint cycle to open up.</p>

      <p class="medium">Karina shared that the very first workflow that they set up in Vero was a standard onboarding campaign, consisting of a two-week series and emails with valuable content.</p>

            <p class="medium">The next workflow (as seen to the left), though, was a little more complex, where customers were segmented into two groups: sign ups via lead magnets, or sign ups via account registration. And different content was created for each of the two segments.</p>

            <p class="medium">As a product-led business, Vero was useful for Plann because it fulfilled their need to trigger the right message at the right time for a seamless workflow. </p>

      <h3 class="tubs regular">üéØ Increased team confidence</h3>

      <p class="medium">Working with Vero, Plann was able to:</p>

      <ul class="medium stack-0">
        <li>Customize user properties to ensure data cleanliness.</li>
        <li>Create a more robust, scalable user experience.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="medium">Vero‚Äôs flexible data properties and event tracking have empowered Plann‚Äôs operations team to set up their data their way, which ensures data cleanliness and readability. Plann, having invested in the process,  reaped the rewards in increased team confidence when segmenting users and creating campaigns.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p class="medium">Messaging hundreds of thousand of users requires scalability, and Plann wanted to ensure they worked with a robust, global, scalable partner. As Plann‚Äôs audience is largely US-based, Karina (Sydney-based) remembers having to set her alarm for 04:00 am to ensure that emails had gone out on time.</p>

      <h3 class="tubs regular">üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Get new ideas live, faster</h3>
      <p class="medium">With Vero, Plann has been able to:</p>

      <ul class="medium stack-0">
        <li>Update email content for automated messages without opening an engineering ticket.</li>
        <li>Create and use new customer segments quickly.</li>
        <li>Run A/B tests without writing code.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="medium">Since moving to Vero, Plann has been able to run A/B tests and segment their audience quickly and easily. Karina said that they‚Äôve seen an uplift in open rates as the cumulative result of experimenting with different subject lines across multiple follow-up emails, all segmented to the right audience to avoid message fatigue.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p class="medium">She shared that by using Vero, Plann‚Äôs best performing open rate was at <strong>32.1%, averaging at 3% click-through-rate</strong> for their best performing content.</p>

      <p class="medium">And setting up segments within Vero, takes only minutes: &ldquo;It's so easy to set up segments including resend a. It literally takes five minutes to create, change the subject line and re-trigger our newsletter to unopens. We can easily bump our newsletter open rates to over 25% by doing these resends and through testing,&rdquo; said Karina.</p>

    <p class="medium">She believes that Vero was built for marketers, as it has helped empower non-technical team members to build email campaigns without much engineering support. &ldquo;Once our tech team has set up the event triggers, it‚Äôs really easy for our marketing team to build out emails and workflows without relying on IT help.&rdquo;</p>

    <div>
      <h3 class="tubs regular">üîÆ Increased visibility</h3>

      <p class="medium">With Vero, Karina said Plann was able to improve their goal setting and feedback loop thanks to the increased visibility. Something as simple as seeing the overall results of a Workflow, and exporting or screenshotting the impact of each message within enables Plann to get the big picture view that they were looking for, fast.</p>
